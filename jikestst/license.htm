claims of such patents necessarily infringed by Original Code; and 2)
YOUR Program includes more than 60% of the Original Code.  No patent
license or other right is granted to YOU by IBM: to have the Original
Code made for YOU by a third party; with respect to any hardware or
software other than the Original Code, notwithstanding that such
hardware or software may incorporate the Original Code; or for the
combination of the Original Code with any other hardware or software,

action against such Contributor for intellectual property
infringement.

<p> In the event that YOU are a Contributor, YOU represent that,
except as disclosed in YOUR contribution, YOUR contributions are YOUR
original creation(s) and, to the best of YOUR knowledge, no third
party has any claim (including but not limited to intellectual
