        * ChangeLog: Revisionism sucks, but this is a revisionist
        change. What I've done it to make the ChangeLog agree with
        the cvs history, basically because I've been less than
        complete in updating it. :( The only reason I can get away
	with this is that I'm the only one that has commited changes,
	so my local cvs repo has all the change information. This wont
	work in the future.

2001-03-02  Christopher Abbey  <cabbey@bresnanlink.net>
