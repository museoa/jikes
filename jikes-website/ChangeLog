	Remove some unneeded bits and note that
	make should be run a `make` not `./make`.

2001-10-13  Chris Abbey  <jikes@cabbey.net>

	* index.shtml: softened a bit of wording to appease the
	IBM-Sun relationship handlers who were affraid someone
	from Sun might be offended if they clicked through from a
	new project that is being announced monday. Also took the
	opportunity to add some verbage to make it clear how much
	support IBM still gives Jikes. *cough*very*little*cough*

2001-05-07  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* faq/dev-win32.shtml:
	Remove section on CVS. Fix up remaining
	build notes and update a broken link

	perfect patch.

	* todo.shtml: updates relative to what has happened recently.

2001-03-19  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* faq/dev-win32.shtml:
	Overhaul the Installing Mingw and
	Building Jikes with Mingw sections.
	Fixed some silly spelling mistakes
	in the Cygwin section. Use $ prompt
	in bash examples, remove the explicit
	Output: before program output. Only
	describe the build process where
	the mingw g++ is put ahead of the
	Cygwin g++ to simplify things.
	Use an example dir /usr/local/mingw
	instead of [mingw dir] since that
	is likely to confuse people. Add
	link to WinZip in case Windows
	users do not have it installed
	already.

2001-03-03  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* faq/dev-win32.shtml:

	page and HTTP based installer download.
	Remove description of setting the Windows
	PATH to make Cygwin tools available in
	dos mode. Added list of packages that
	were not strictly required for the
	minimum download and install. Add
	link to bash tutorial.

2001-03-03  Christopher Abbey  <cabbey@bresnanlink.net>

        * ChangeLog: Revisionism sucks, but this is a revisionist
        change. What I've done it to make the ChangeLog agree with
        the cvs history, basically because I've been less than
        complete in updating it. :( The only reason I can get away
	with this is that I'm the only one that has commited changes,
	so my local cvs repo has all the change information. This wont
	work in the future.

2001-03-02  Christopher Abbey  <cabbey@bresnanlink.net>

	* faq/bug-reporting.shtml: fixed bad table border, left over
