      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary:</span> This thesis
details several improvements in the field of automatic parser
generation, which are embodied in the JikesPG parser.&nbsp; Techniques
are described for reducing the space requirements of the parser while
allowing token lookahead of more than one token, improving the
incremental construction of such a parser from a grammar, and for
allowing error recovery in the parser while maintaining fast parsing
speed for bottom-up parsing. (summary by Eric Blake)</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</span> LR parsing is
used for a wide range of applications, including compiler construction,
automatic code generation, language-specific editors and natural
language processing. Currently, however, solutions have not been
developed for practical multiple-lookahead parsing, fully-automatic
error recovery, and space and time-efficient LR parsing across the
wide-range of applications.<br>
A practical framework for LR(k) parsing is introduced. An efficient
algorithm incrementally constructs an LALR(k) parser with varying-length
lookahead strings, whose symbols are consulted during parsing only when
necessary. Currently, effective LR error recovery systems require some
user intervention. An effective and fully automated syntactic error
recovery method for LR(k) parsers is presented. A generally effective
method for compressing LR(k) parsing tables is also presented.<br>
These innovations have been incorporated into a parser generator system
with automatically produces a production-quality parser with error
diagnostics and recovery.</p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary:</span> This paper
gives an overview of the algorithms that can be used by parsers to have
automatic error recovery in minimal space.&nbsp; The paper details the
error recovery elements that allow the parser to detect both simple
(one-token) and complex (multi-token) errors without penalizing the
parse of a syntactically correct program.&nbsp; The output of JikesPG
provides the necessary structures to use these algorithms
effectively.&nbsp;(summary by Eric Blake)</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</span> In this
paper, a new practical, efficient and language-independent syntactic
error recovery method for LR(k) parsers is presented. This method is
similar to and builds upon the three-level approach of Burke-Fisher.
However, it is more time- and space-efficient and fully automatic. </p>
