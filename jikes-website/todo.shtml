    <h1>Jikes' ToDo List</h1>
    <p>The items herein are work that needs to be done, if there is someone known to be working on an item then I'll
    list their name so as to reduce redundancy and provide a point of contact for anyone interested in helping out
    with this task. If you've got some time to aid any of these tasks post a note to the
    <a href="/developerworks/mail/?group_id=10">Jikes-Dev list</a>. <small>(and yes, it's also to keep us honest ;)</small></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Migrate old jitterbug bugs to new system. (TAG, EricB, CAbbey, more welcome)
