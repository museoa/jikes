    <h1>Jikes' Project ToDo List</h1>
    <p>The items herein are work that needs to be done from an overall project management standpoint, see also the
    <a href="/developerworks/opensource/cvs/jikes/~checkout~/jikes/TODO">TODO list in CVS</a> for a list of what
    needs to be done in the source.

    If there is someone known to be working on an item then I'll
    list their name so as to reduce redundancy and provide a point of contact for anyone interested in helping out
    with this task. If you've got some time to aid any of these tasks post a note to the
    <a href="/developerworks/mail/?group_id=10">Jikes-Dev list</a>. <small>(and yes, it's also to keep us honest ;)</small></p>

    <ul>
      <li>New developer recruitment.
      <li>Finish the FAQ. (Pascal, Andrew Inggs)
      <li>Finish bringing new web pages online. (Pascal)
      <li>complete the documentation of bug system categories, priorities and groups. (cabbey)
      <li>Bring Jikes up to Java2 classpath handling. (Adam Hawthorne)
      <li>Convert the old Jikestst tests into Jacks tests.
      <li>Write a class introspector in TCL for use in Jacks testcases. (earmarked for cabbey)
      <li>Move the old Sun Queries from the research database to a web page.
      <li>Fix the bugs that are known, triage the ones that are brand new.
      <li>Update both todo lists.
    </ul>

    <p>This is of course an open source document, so if there's something I've missed just post a patch to the list.</p>
