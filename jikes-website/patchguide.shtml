<h1>Jikes Patches Guidelines</h1>

<p>The Jikes project welcomes patches, but cannot promise that every
patch submitted will be accepted. Patches should be submitted to the
<a href="/developerworks/patch/?group_id=10">patch queue</a>.

<p>Here are some guidelines on submitting a patch. If you make it
hard for us to evaluate and incorporate the patch, then it is less
likely we will include it; for example, please:
<ul>
<li>Patch against current version of source.
<li>Use same coding conventions: indenting levels, position of braces, ...
<li>Provide a description of your patch in the standard <code>ChangeLog</code>
 format. Do not however include it as part of the patch. That is to say, do
 not patch ChangeLog, simply include the text with the patch. See an example
 ChangeLog entry below.
<li>Include your e-mail address in the <code>ChangeLog</code> notice.
<li>Provide the patch in <code>diff</code> unified output format 
(<code>-u</code> option of GNU <code>diff</code>).
<li>Generate your patch from the module name level of the tree. For example, if you
 need to patch ast.h the patch should be generated from within the jikes directory
 and reference the file as src/ast.h, rather than in the src directory referencing
 the file as ast.h. <small>(It is really a minor item, but it helps immensly if we
 are consistent, and that is the "standard" way of doing it.)</small>
</ul>

<p>Some notes on this: The changelog lines are indented with a single
tab, not with spaces. The "ChanegLog:" header was probably inserted by
his software, just incase we didn't recognize what the following text
was, but since he has followed the format this isn't a problem. 

The text "end of patch" has been added AFTER the
end of the patch because the last line of the patch is empty. That is
to say there are three lines following the last inserted line (marked
with a + character) in the patch, but the last of those is empty. By
adding some piece of text there that doesn't look like the start of a 
new patch the trailing line will not get lost and the maintainers will
not have problems patching this into the tree.
