<h1>Jikes Patches Guidlines</h1>

<p>The Jikes project welcomes patches, but cannot promise that every
patch submitted will be accepted. Patches should be submitted to the
<a href="/developerworks/patch/?group_id=10">patch queue</a>.

<p>Here are some guidelines on submitting a patch. If you make it
hard for us to evaluate and incorporate the patch, then it is less
likely we will include it; for example, please:
<ul>
<li>Patch against current version of source.
<li>Use same coding conventions: indenting levels, position of braces, ...
<li>Provide a description of patch in the <code>ChangeLog</code> file style.
<li>Include your e-mail address in the <code>ChangeLog</code> notice.
<li>Provide the patch in <code>diff</code> unified output format 
(<code>-u</code> option of GNU <code>diff</code>).
</ul>
