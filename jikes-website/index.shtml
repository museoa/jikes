<p>What is Jikes?</p>
<P>Jikes<small><sup>TM</sup></small> is a compiler that translates Java<small><sup>TM</sup></small> source files as defined in
<a href="http://www.java.sun.com/docs/books/jls">The Java Language Specification</a>
into the bytecoded instruction set and binary format defined in
<a href="http://www.java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec">The Java Virtual Machine Specification</a>.</P>

<!--TODO: this needs to be trimmed down some, room for compression still... -->

<P>
You may wonder why the world needs another Java compiler, considering that Sun provides
javac free with its SDK. Jikes has four advantages that make it a valuable contribution to
the Java community:
    <UL>
        <LI><em>Open source</em>. <STRONG>Jikes is <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/docs/certification_mark.html">OSI Certified Open Source Software</A>.</strong>
            OSI Certified is a certification mark of the 
	    <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a>.</LI>
        <LI><em>Strictly Java compatible</em>. Jikes strives to adhere to both The Java
            Language Specification and The Java Virtual Machine Specification as
            tightly as possible, and does not support subsets, supersets, or
            other variations of the language. The <!--A HREF="faq.shtml"-->FAQ<!--/A--> describes
            some of the side effects of this strict language conformance.</LI>
        <LI><em>High performance</em>. Jikes is a high performance compiler, making
            it ideal for use with larger projects.</LI>
        <LI><em>Dependency analysis</em>. Jikes performs a dependency analysis on
            your code that provides two very useful features: Incremental builds
            and makefile generation.</LI>
    </UL>
<p>Abridged from <!--a href="faq.shtml"-->a FAQ entry<!--/A--> which was adapted from
some material by Lou Grinzo for an article he wrote, the link I have for which is no longer valid.</p>

<p>It's worth pointing out that Jikes is not, and is not intended to be, a complete
development environment -- it is simply a command line compiler. It should not be
considered a replacement for more complete tools, such as <A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/sourcenav/">
Source Navigator</A> or <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/software/ad/vajava/">IBM's VisualAge for Java</A>
which provide sophisticated graphical IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).</P>

<p>The Jikes compiler was released in binary form in April 1997 on the IBM 
<A HREF="http://ibm.com/alphaworks/">alphaWorks</A> site.  Jikes for Linux
was released on 15 July 1998. The response was overwhelming -- Jikes had more
downloads in the three months after the announcement than in the fifteen months
before the announcement.</P>

<p>Release of Jikes for Linux was soon followed by requests to open up the source. 
Many notes and comments from users suggested this would be a good idea.  The 
source was released under a liberal license in December 1998 to make a very 
visible demonstration of IBM's commitment to open standards and to Java Technology, to make 
Jikes more reliable and accessible, to encourage more widespread use of Java Technology, to 
encourage standardization of Java Technology, and to gain some experience actually running 
an open source project.  This marked the start of one of IBM's first efforts in 
the open source arena.</P>

<P>The original alphaWorks version of Jikes was written by Philippe Charles and Dave 
Shields of the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center. Since the release of the source
they have continued to work on the compiler as contributors; however recently have
officially been moved on to other projects within IBM. Today there are no IBMers who
work on Jikes as part of their job description. Jikes survives today soley based on
the free time contributions of members of the open sourse community.

<P>The source code is available under
<a href="/developerworks/opensource/license10.html">IBM's Public License</a>,
which has been approved by the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">OSI</a>
(Open Source Initiative) as a fully certified open source license.
The project provides access to the complete <A HREF="cvs.shtml">CVS</A>
development tree, which includes not only Jikes, but also the source for the Jacks
Test Suite and the Jikes Parser Generator used to build Jikes. Members of the community
contribute <A HREF="/developerworks/downloads/index.php?group_id=10&recent_only=1">binaries</A>
for their platforms of choice, additionally
Jikes is included in many <A HREF="distribs.shtml">Open Source Operating Systems</A>.
The Jacks Test Suite is a replacement for the Jikestst package, and it is expected
to replace it over time.</p>

<P>The fact that Jikes is a high-performance, highly compatible Java
compiler that can be used on almost any computing platform makes it
an interesting program and worth investigating for almost any Java
programmer. But Jikes is also notable because it lies at the center
of two events: the adoption of open source philosophy and practice by
large corporations, and the continued growth of Java for Linux.</p>


The Jikes project is a collaborative software development project dedicated to 
providing a compiler from Java source code to bytecode that is conformant, 
robust, full-featured, commercial-quality, and freely available. This project is 
overseen by a group of companies and individual volunteers throughout the world, 
using the internet to communicate, plan, and develop the compiler and its 
related software and documentation.





We provide the source code for Jikes, a parser generator, and a test suite under 
a liberal <a href="../license10.html">license</a>.

<p>

We provide prebuilt binary versions for AIX, Linux Intel, Solaris Sparc, and 
Windows95/NT. See <a href="../jikes/project/ports.html">ports</a> for a list of 
known ports to other systems (some of the authors of these ports also provide 
binary versions); see <a href="../jikes/project/distrib.html">distributions</a> 
for a list software distributions known to include Jikes.

<p>
The original version of Jikes, first released in binary form in April 1997, was 
written by Philippe Charles and Dave Shields of the IBM T. J. Watson Research 
Center.  Since the release of the source in December 1998 they have continued to 
work on the compiler as contributors.
