    As you can see, Jikes has moved again. We're now hosted at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">
    SourceForge&reg;</a>. This move was a result of IBM's decision to pull out
    of the project hosting space. Since there was a great amount of similarity
    between sf.net and dw/oss, the change will be mostly cosmetic.

<p>What is Jikes?</p>
<P>Jikes<small><sup>TM</sup></small> is a compiler that translates Java<small><sup>TM</sup></small> source files as defined in
<a href="http://www.java.sun.com/docs/books/jls">The Java Language Specification</a>
into the bytecoded instruction set and binary format defined in
<a href="http://www.java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec">The Java Virtual Machine Specification</a>.</P>

<!--TODO: this needs to be trimmed down some, room for compression still... -->

<P>
You may wonder why the world needs another Java compiler, considering that Sun provides
javac free with its SDK. Jikes has five advantages that make it a valuable contribution to
the Java community:
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/certification_mark.html"><img src="http://opensource.org/trademarks/osi-certified/web/transparent/osi-certified-120x100-t.png" width="120" height="100" alt="[OSI Certified Logo]" border="0" align=right hspace=4 vspace=4></a>
    <UL>
        <LI><em>Open source</em>. <STRONG>Jikes is <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/docs/certification_mark.html">OSI Certified Open Source Software</A>.</strong>
            OSI Certified is a certification mark of the 
	    <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a>.</LI>
        <LI><em>Strictly Java compatible</em>. Jikes strives to adhere to both The Java
            Language Specification and The Java Virtual Machine Specification as
            tightly as possible, and does not support subsets, supersets, or
            other variations of the language. The FAQ describes
            some of the side effects of this strict language conformance.</LI>
        <LI><em>High performance</em>. Jikes is a high performance compiler, making
            it ideal for use with larger projects.</LI>
        <LI><em>Dependency analysis</em>. Jikes performs a dependency analysis on
            your code that provides two very useful features: Incremental builds
            and makefile generation.</LI>
	<LI><em>Constructive Assistance</em>. Jikes strives to help the
            programmer write better code in two key ways. Jikes has always
	    strived to provide clear error and warning text to assist the
	    programmer in understanding problems, and now with release 1.19
	    Jikes helps point out common programming mistakes as documented in
	    <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/effective/">Effective Java</a>.
	    
    </UL>
<p>Abridged from a FAQ entry which was adapted from
some material by Lou Grinzo for an article he wrote.</p>

<P>The fact that Jikes is a high-performance, highly compatible Java
compiler that can be used on almost any computing platform makes it
an interesting program and worth investigating for almost any Java
programmer. But Jikes is also notable because it lies at the center
of two events: the adoption of open source philosophy and practice by
large corporations, and the continued growth of Java for Linux.</p>

<p>It's worth pointing out that Jikes is not, and is not intended to be, a complete
development environment -- it is simply a command line compiler. It should not be
considered a replacement for more complete tools, such as <A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/sourcenav/">
Source Navigator</A> or <A HREF="http://www.ibm.com/software/ad/vajava/">IBM's VisualAge for Java</A>
which provide sophisticated graphical IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).</P>

<p>The Jikes compiler was released in binary form in April 1997 on the IBM 
<A HREF="http://ibm.com/alphaworks/">alphaWorks</A> site.  Jikes for Linux
was released on 15 July 1998. The response was overwhelming -- Jikes had more
downloads in the three months after the announcement than in the fifteen months
before the announcement. Around the end of March 2002, IBM opened a fledgling
community hosting location attached to their
<a href="http://www-136.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/">developerWorks</a>
site with Jikes as a founding member. Approximately 3 years later this server
was decommissioned and the most active projects migrated into SourceForge.net
hosting options. During those three years Jikes was the #1 most popular
project every month, often by a large margin. We approached nearly 250,000
downloads while residing at dw/oss, and had been consistently tallying triple
digit daily downloads.</P>

<p>Release of Jikes for Linux was soon followed by requests to open up the source. 
Many notes and comments from users suggested this would be a good idea.  The 
source was released under a liberal license in December 1998 to make a very 
visible demonstration of IBM's commitment to open standards and to Java Technology, to make 
Jikes more reliable and accessible, to encourage more widespread use of Java Technology, to 
encourage standardization of Java Technology, and to gain some experience actually running 
an open source project.  This marked the start of one of IBM's first efforts in 
the open source arena.</P>

<P>The original alphaWorks version of Jikes was written by Philippe Charles and Dave 
Shields of the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center. For awhile after the release of the
source they continued to work on the compiler as contributors; however, shortly after
the project migrated to developerWorks' Open Source Server they were
officially moved off onto other projects within IBM. Today there are no IBMers
who work on Jikes as part of their job description. Jikes survives today soley
based on the free time contributions of members of the open source community.

<P>The source code is available under
<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-ipl.html">IBM's Public License</a>,
which has been approved by the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">OSI</a>
(Open Source Initiative) as a fully certified open source license.
The project provides access to the complete <A HREF="cvs.shtml">CVS</A>
development tree, which includes not only Jikes, but also the source for the Jacks
Test Suite and the Jikes Parser Generator used to build Jikes.<!-- Members of the community

Jikes is included in many <A HREF="distribs.shtml">Open Source Operating Systems</A>.
The Jacks Test Suite is a replacement for the Jikestst package.</p>
