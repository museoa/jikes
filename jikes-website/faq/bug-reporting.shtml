     <h1>So you think you've found a bug?</h1>
     <p>Well, ya know what... we're all just human, and compilers for any language
       are very difficult beasties to write so you may very well have done just that.
       Here's what we need you to do inorder to correct this problem, without your
       help the odds of this bug being fixed are infinitesimally small.</p>
     <h2>Overview of process from here:</h2>
     <ol style="text-align:left;">
      <li>Verify that this isn't a WKB (Well Known Bug, aka a FRB (Frequently Reported Bug)).</li>
      <li>Verify that this is infact a Jikes bug.</li>
      <li>Check that this bug is not already reported.</li>
      <li>Collect the information needed for a jikes bug report.</li>
      <li>Report the bug.</li>
      <li>Assist in the elimination of the bug.</li>
      <li>Verify the bug has been fixed.</li>
     </ol>
     <h1>Verify that this isn't a WKB</h1>
     <p>Anytime we have a brown paper bag incident it will be listed here, if your bug is listed
       here and you still report it, expect to be ignored unless you have some new information; in
       which case you should append your information to the existing bug. (please don't append "me
       too, you should fix this" type of messages.) <span style="background-color:#ffcccc;">Current
       status is indicated thusly.</span></p>

       not in the new bug system.<span style="background-color:#ffcccc;">These issues do not appear to be resolved in 1.13, but are
       being investigated by a number of people, we're hoping for a fix post 1.13.</span></dd>
      <dt>Build related issues</dt>
       <dd>There were a number of these. <span style="background-color:#ffcccc;">There was a completely new build system put into
       place for 1.12, if you've not tried to build anything newer than 1.11 try again now. There is one notable exception
       to this currently: <a href="/developerworks/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=110&amp;group_id=10">HP/UX</a>
       remains a problem. We need an HP/UX compiler expert to assist with this.</span></dd>
      <dt>Classpath crashes</dt>
       <dd>Older Jikes builds (~1.06 - 1.11) would occasionally drop core due to the length of the classpath (not so much that
       it was too long, as that it was "oddly mod 2" long, this also veried based on the platform and how it's compiler laid out
       memory - excelent example of what happens when you tromple someone else memory in C++ ;). <span style="background-color:#ffcccc;">
       FIXED in 1.12 (partially) and 1.13 (completely?)</span>.</dd>
      <dt>HP/UX</dt>

        <a href="/developerworks/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=240&amp;group_id=10">240</a>. We currently can not
        build Jikes on HP/UX. <span style="background-color:#ffcccc;">We need an HP/UX compiler expert to help figure
        out what's wrong and fix it.</span></dd>

     <p>If your bug wasn't listed above, move on to the next check.</p>
     <h1>Verify that this is infact a Jikes bug</h1>
     <p>This is basically a sanity check, and a chance for you to prevent embarasement. Some things to check:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>spelling and existence of all entires in classpath and jikespath.</li>
      <li>spelling and existence of all command line options, source files, destination directories, etc.</li>
      <li>what do some of the other compilers say about your source? If they all say it is in error what does the lang spec say about it?<li>
      <li>what do some other JVMs say about the class files jikes produces? Do they all object to it, or just one?</li>
     </ul>
     <p>If you're still seeing this as a bug in Jikes, move on to the next check.</p>
     <h1>Check that this bug is not already reported</h1>
     <p>Like I said, we're all human and compilers are inherently difficult pieces of code. As a result there
      are bugs in Jikes, to say otherwise would be a lie. A fair number of bugs have already been identified and
      are in the Jikes Bug Collection. The purpose of this step is to take a look at some of the existing bugs
      and see if yours is a duplicate of one of these already existing bugs. The bugs in the collection are generally
      divided into the following categories, you should read the description of each and decide which your bug belongs
      in (maybe two, but probably not three or more). Once you've decided then take the link with each and skim the
      list of bugs returned, you may need to read the details of a bug before determining if it is yours or not.</p>
     <dl>
      <dt><a href="/developerworks/bugs/index.php?group_id=10&amp;set=custom&amp;_status=1&amp;_category=105">Parser</a></dt>
       <dd>The parser is responsible for converting your source code into the Abstract Symbol Tree that the 
        compiler uses internally to produce classes. Errors such as not recognizing a method name, or not
        seeing that a block could throw a certain type of exception would belong to the parser.</dd>
      <dt><a href="/developerworks/bugs/index.php?group_id=10&amp;set=custom&amp;_status=1&amp;_category=106">Emitter</a></dt>
       <dd>The emitter is responsible for turning the AST produced by the parser into bytecode in classfiles.
        Errors such as not emiting a branch argument that would lead outside the method, or any other bytecode
        that would cause a classfile to fail verification woulc belong to the emitter.</dd>
      <dt><a href="/developerworks/bugs/index.php?group_id=10&amp;set=custom&amp;_status=1&amp;_category=107">Dependencies</a></dt>
       <dd>The dependency subsystem is responsible for tracking what classes make use of what other classes. A bug against
        the dependency tracker might be if a class should have been recompiled because other classes changed, but it wasn't.</dd>
      <dt><a href="/developerworks/bugs/index.php?group_id=10&amp;set=custom&amp;_status=1&amp;_category=108">User Interface</a></dt>
       <dd>The user interface is responsible for dealing with command line options, and reading user environment variables,
        an exmaple bug against the UI is that the usage test ignores the -Xstdout argument and prints to stderr.</dd>
      <dt><a href="/developerworks/bugs/index.php?group_id=10&amp;set=custom&amp;_status=1&amp;_category=109">Build</a></dt>
       <dd>Use the build component if the jikes source code fails to compile on your platform, examples include faulty
        logic in ./configure tests.</dd>
      <dt><a href="/developerworks/bugs/index.php?group_id=10&amp;set=custom&amp;_status=1&amp;_category=110"></a>Sepcifications</dt>
       <dd>This component is used to track Jikes' compliance with specification issues, and more often to track when clarification
        is needed from Sun.</dd>
      <dt><a href="/developerworks/bugs/index.php?group_id=10&amp;set=custom&amp;_status=1&amp;_category=111"></a>Documentation / Web</dt>
       <dd>This component is used report problems either in the website, or the shipped documentation. For example, if a link goes
        404.</dd>
      <dt><a href="/developerworks/bugs/index.php?group_id=10&amp;set=custom&amp;_status=1&amp;_category=120"></a>Suggestion or Feature Request</dt>
       <dd>This one should be self explanatory, RFEs go here.</dd>
     </dl>
     <p>If you do find your bug in one of the above categories already then you should evaluate if you have any additional information
      you can add to the existing bug, such as a simpler testcase, or a backtrace of a core fault or assertion. See the next section for
      some of the common information we need to properly deal with a bug, if the original report doesn't contain some of that info, can
      you supply it? If so please append it to the existing bug. If on the otherhand you do not see your bug in any of the existing ones,
      please continue to the next step and collect the information needed for your new bug.</p>
