            <h1>Jikes on Mac</h1>
            <p>Jikes has been successfully compiled and used on MacOS X 10.2
              (Jaguar).</p>
            <h2>Development tools</h2>
            <p>You'll need Apple's Developer Tools to compile Jikes. Although
              they come with Mac OS X 10.2, they're not installed by default.
              You can install them from the gray Developer Tools CD-ROM that
              accompanied the other Mac OS X CD-ROMS, or you can download a
              disk image free from
              <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/index.html">Apple's
              Developer website</a>.</p>
            <p>The Developer Tools installation includes the GUI tools
              such as ProjectBuilder and many of the underlying GNU tools
              you know and love from other Unixes, including all the ones
              you'll need to build Jikes.
            <p>The command-line tools are installed in <tt>/usr/bin/</tt>
              which will already be on your <tt>PATH</tt>.</p>
            <h2>Building Jikes</h2>
            <p>Once you've installed the Apple Developer Tools, you can simply
              follow the generic <a href="dev-compiling.shtml">compiling
              instructions</a> in the Jikes Developer FAQ.</p>
