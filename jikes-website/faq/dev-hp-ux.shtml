        This workaround can be found multiple times in this file.

            <p><i>Not explained and formatted yet.</i></p>
            <h2>Source control</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing special : just use WebCVS or install a HP-UX 
              CVS client on your machine (if not already installed).</p>
            <h2>Compiling</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;gcc does work just fine (I think the lab has gcc 2.95.2 
              installed); it probably does not need any more commentary than what 
              a normal Unix install requires. However, CC must be brain-dead. 
              I still haven't figured out all the magic source incantations to 
              make CC like jikes. After some heavy code tweaking, I managed to 
              create a .o for every .cpp file using CC -I. -ext -c *.o, but still 
              could not link them together into an executable. Even after tweaking 
              some code, CC emits tons of warnings of bool being a future keyword, 
              but not a currently supported one, of the signed keyword being ignored, 
              of parameters not being used in the method, and other such fun things. 
              CC still thinks overload is a keyword, not a variable name, and 
              that was a fatal error in a few places. It also has problems inlining 
              any code that contains a loop. For now, I would just mention in 
              the FAQ that CC for the HP is an unsupported compiler at the moment.</p>
