            <h1>Jikes on HP-UX</h1>
            <p>Jikes has been successfully compiled for HP-UX 10.20
            and later, using either gcc or aCC.  At the moment, there
            is no official HP-UX binary; you will need to build your
            own.</p>
            <h3>Special information</h3>
            <p>Sun has not released JDK 1.2 or later for HP-UX 10.20.
            Jikes should run fine targeting classes.zip in JDK 1.1.8,
            but you will not be able to use anything in the Java 2 API
            (such as the Collections framework or javax.swing).  One
            option is using an alternate implementation; if you have a
            VM that supports Java 2, it should have the classfiles
            that Jikes needs to link to.  The other alternative is to
            point to a copy of ${JAVA}/jre/lib/rt.jar on another
            platform.  The .jar file is platform-independent, so Jikes
            will compile the Java 2 API without problems, but your
            resulting .class files will then require a Java 2
            compliant VM to run.</p>
	    <p>It has been reported that when compiling with gcc3 on HP-UX 11 the
	    </code>ac_cv_header_iconv_h=no</code> paramater to configure is needed.</p>
            <h2>Source control</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Nothing special</i> : just use WebCVS or
            install a HP-UX CVS client on your machine (if not already
            installed).  For more information on CVS, see elsewhere in
            this FAQ.</p>
            <h2>Compiling</h2>
            <h3>Compiling with gcc</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Nothing special</i> : this should work
            like any other *nix clone: <code>./configure</code>, then
            <code>make</code>.</p>
            <h3>Compiling with aCC</h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Minor tweaks required</i> : Unfortunately, at
            this time, aCC will not compile jikes out of the box.
            However, the changes required are minimal, and this
            situation may be remedied by 1.14.  You will need
            <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/patch/?func=detailpatch&patch_id=55&group_id=10">
            this patch</a> from the queue, since aCC does not like
            ostream &gt;&gt; unsigned char *.</p>
            <p>If you want 64-bit integer math, you will need to
            configure with the -ext flag.  Also, Jikes has a number of
            non-standard C++ constructs at the moment (again, this
            will hopefully be fixed by 1.14), which cause aCC to emit
            a number of warnings.  Therefore, the recommended
            configure call is:</p>
            <div style="text-align: center"> 
              <table width="400" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" align="center">
                <tr> 
                  <td class="HighlightedFrameBorder"> 
                    <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">
                      <tr> 
                        <td class="HighlightedFrameBackground">
                        <code>./configure CXX=aCC CXXFLAGS="-g -O -ext
                        +W740 +W741 +W749"</code>
                        </td>
                      </tr>
                    </table>
                  </td>
                </tr>
              </table>
            </div>
            <p>From this point, a simple <code>make</code> should
            complete the job.</p>
            <h3>No support for CC</h3>
            <p>Sorry, but no one has submitted a success story with the
            old CC compiler.  If you can get it to work, please pass
            that information on to the mailing lists.</p>
            <h2>Testing the build</h2>
            <p>Now that you've gone to the trouble of building Jikes
            on HP-UX, it is a good idea to test it out.  You will need
            to check out the Jacks module, and have Tcl 8.3 installed
            on your machine.  For more details on the testing process,
            see <a href="dev-testing.shtml">testing</a>.  If you find
            any platform-specific regressions, report them to the
            mailing lists (including a patch is even better!).</p>
