<h1>Jikes Steering Committee</h1>

<p>The Jikes project is overseen by a small group of individuals known
as the Jikes Steering Committee. This group has the following responsibilities: 

<UL>
        <LI>Enforcing strict compliance to the language specification.
        <LI>Deciding which features go into which releases when
	the project administrators are unable to decide.
        <LI>Appointing new members of the Steering Committee and new Project
	Administrators.
</UL>

New members of the Jikes Steering Committee are added when a frequent
contributor is nominated by a member of the Steering Committee and unanimously
approved by all members. The goal is to keep the
membership of the Committee low (5 to 10 people) in order to
minimize the amount of bureaucratic overhead required to keep the
project running. 

<P>
In the unlikely event that a member of the Steering Committee becomes
disruptive to the development process or ceases to contribute for a
long period, he or she may be removed by a unanimous vote of the
remaining members of the Steering Committee.

<P>The current members of the Jikes Steering Committee are listed on the
<a href="people.shtml">people page</a>

<h1>Jikes Project Administrators</h1>
<p>The day to day, and release to release decisions on the project
are handled by the <a href="people.shtml#admin">Project Administrators</a>.
They have read-write access to the CVS repository and administrative control
over the Jikes Project space within developerWorks.

<P>
In the unlikely event that a Project Administrator becomes
disruptive to the development process or ceases to contribute for a
long period, he or she may be removed by a majority vote of the
Steering Committee. New Project Administrators will be named on
an as needed basis by the Steering Committee and will in most cases
have been actively contributing to the project for at least a year.
<!--except chris, who seems to have given himself a promotion in the
process of rewriting this web page-->

<h1>Jikes Contributors</h1>
<p>Contributors are individual or company-affiliated developers who have
registered developer level access to the Jikes Project in developerWorks.
New Jikes contributors are added when a developer is recognized by the
Project Administrators or a member of the Steering Committee and is approved
by at least half of the Steering Committee, without any &quot;no&quot;
votes, or by unanimous agreement of the Project Administrators. In most cases,
new contributors will have already been participating in the development process
by submitting patches, bug reports, test cases and/or binaries for at least
a few months.

<p>Contributors are listed on the <a href="people.shtml#contrib">people page</a>.
