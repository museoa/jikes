<h1>Jikes Steering Committee</h1>

<p>The Jikes project is managed by a small, core group of
individuals known as the Jikes Steering Committee. In addition to having
read-write access to the Jikes source code repository, this group has
the following responsibilities: 

<UL>
        <LI>Enforcing strict compliance to the language specification
        <LI>Deciding which features go into which releases 
        <LI>Deciding who has access to the Jikes source code repository (who is a Jikes <I>contributor</I>) 
        <LI>Approving the check-in of new or changed source code and documentation 
        <LI>Appointing new members of the core team. 
        <LI>Updating the Jikes charter, if necessary. 
</UL>

New members of the Jikes Steering Committee are added when a frequent
contributor is nominated by a member of the Steering Committee and unanimously
approved by all members. In most cases, developers will have actively
contributed to Jikes development for at least six months before being
considered for membership on the Steering Committee. The goal is to keep the
membership of the core group low (5 to 10 people) in order to
minimize the amount of bureaucratic overhead required to keep the
project running. 

<P>
In the unlikely event that a member of the Steering Committee becomes
disruptive to the development process or ceases to contribute for a
long period, he or she may be removed by a unanimous vote of the
remaining members of the Steering Committee.

<P>The Steering Committee is responsible for maintaining and updating the Jikes
charter. Any changes to the development process necessitate a change to the
charter. Changes must be unanimously approved by all members of the Steering Committee.

<P>The current members of the Jikes Steering Committee are listed on the
<a href="people.shtml">people page</a>

<h1>Jikes contributors</h1>
<p>In addition to the Jikes Steering Committee, there may be a number of
<I>contributors</I> to the Jikes project. Contributors are individual
or company-affiliated developers who have read-write access to the
Jikes source code repository. New Jikes contributors are added when a
developer is nominated by a member of the Steering Committee and is approved
by at least 50% of the Steering Committee members, with no &quot;no&quot;
votes. In most cases, new contributors will have already been
participating in the development process by submitting suggestions
and/or fixes using the bug report page or newsgroups. 

<P>No Jikes contributors have yet been named. 

<h1>Jikes steward</h1>
<p>One member of the Jikes Steering Committee, chosen by IBM, serves as the
steward.  Should it become necessary to select a new steward, IBM may
either designate an existing member of the core team, or select a new
person, who then also becomes a member of the Steering Committee.

<p>
IBM is committed to open standards and Java standardization.  The
steward has the responsibility for seeing that the project maintains
as its principal goal strict adherence to the language specification,
and so has unrestricted read-write access to the source repository.

<p>
IBM is committed to certain core values and business practices.  The
Steering Committee respects this commitment, and the steward has the
responsibility to maintain the continued existence of the project,
and extraordinary authority to remedy any situation that, if
unresolved, would make it unacceptable for IBM to provide continuing
support, including the resources used to host the project's web pages.

<p>
It is hoped this extraordinary authority will never be exercised. The
normal role of the steward is that of a Steering Committee member, and it is
expected that he or she make it clear if and when they are excercising
extraordinary powers in the role of steward.

<P>The current steward is:<br>
