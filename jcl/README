This directory contains the source for the IBM Research Jikes
Class Lister, licensed under IBM Public License Version 1.0 - Jikes
Compiler, contained in the file ../license.htm.

The initial source is quite old, and many of the source files are
(much) earlier versions of current source files. It is provided here
as a starting point for work to scrape off the rust, adapt to use the
current source files to read classfiles, etc., with the goal of providing
a usable class lister.

Usage:  jcl classfile

Though there are other class file listers, such as Sun's javap and Mocha,
these tend to emphasize source reconstruction and a high-level view. Jcl
is intended to provide a low-level view, almost at the byte level, as it 
was written to debug problems when Jikes was first developed and was writing
incorrectly-formatted classfiles. 

The author of the original version is David Shields, though many of the
files used to read class files, etc., were of course written by Philippe Charles.

If you have further questions, you can consult the archives of the
Jikes mailing lists, or subscribe to the Jikes list and then seek
help. See http://ibm.com/developerworks/oss/jikes for information on
