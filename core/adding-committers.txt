Adding Committers to the Jikes CVS Repository

In order for someone to be able to commit to the Jikes modules,
two criteria must be met:

1. The person must have an account on the repository machine
   (currently OSS.Software.IBM.Com), and
2. The person's username must be added to the control file in
   the repository's CVSROOT directory.

update from cabbey on 27 April 2001 - the part about adding an
account is no longer correct... it needs to be done through the
dw/oss website. Jikesadmin should go to the Users section and
choose "add user", follow the directions. The new user will be
sent an email to confirm their address and establish their initial
password.

In order to grant commit access to the repository, someone who
has commit access to the CVSROOT module must edit the 'avail'
file.  (Currently only Dave Shields, Ken Coar, and the jikesadmin
account can do this.)

 % cvs -d OSS.Software.IBM.Com:/usr/cvs/jikes co CVSROOT
 % cd CVSROOT
 % emacs avail
 % cvs commit

The format of the 'avail' file is

 <keyword>|<username[,username...]>|<module[module,...]>

'keyword' is either 'avail' or 'unavail', and indicates whether the
listed usernames do or do not have access to the modules at the
end of the line.

Here is a sample line from the avail file:

avail|coar,shields,jikesadmin,lord,ernst,mdejong|jikes,jikestst,site

(The line has been edited to fit on the screen. :-)

And that's it.  Send questions to <Ken.Coar@Golux.Com>.
