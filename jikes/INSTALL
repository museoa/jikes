Compiling and Installing Jikes:

./configure ; make ; make install

Windows users will need to have Cygwin
installed, see the Jikes homepage for
Cygwin install instructions.

If you want to install jikes into a directory
other than the default of /usr/local, pass
a --prefix=DIR argument to the configure script.

If you want to get fancy, you can even build
jikes in a directory other than the source
directory. This is really handy if you
are doing multiple builds or building for
multiple architectures.

(assume you are starting in the jikes directory)
cd ..

mkdir build_linux_debug ; cd build_linux_debug

../jikes/configure --prefix=/tmp/jikes_debug CXXFLAGS=-g
make


mkdir build_linux_opt ; cd build_linux_opt

../jikes/configure --prefix=/tmp/jikes_opt CXXFLAGS=-O3
make


You can even cross compile jikes for another architecture
with a GNU cross compiler. In the following example,
we cross compile jikes for Windows on a Linux box
using the mingw cross compiler (i386-mingw32msvc-c++).

mkdir build_mingw ; cd build_mingw
../jikes/configure --prefix=/tmp/jikes_Xmingw --host=i386-mingw32msvc
