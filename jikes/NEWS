*** Jikes 1.19 was released 1 February 2004.

The default -source and -target options are now 1.4 (that is, the
assert statement now compiles by default); for the old behavior you
must specify -source 1.3 or -target 1.3 at the command line.

Command line options have been improved.
* Some pedantic warnings are controlled by name, so that you can
select which warnings you get (for example, not everyone wants to know
that 1L is preferred over 1l when writing a long literal).
* More switches have long names.
* Default state of switches now printed with --help.
* New switch -Xswitchcheck: Warn about fallthrough in switch
statements (compatible with javac).
* New switch +Pnaming-convention: Warn about naming choices that
violate Java's naming conventions. This switch is currently ON by
default, +Pno-naming-convention will disable it for sites that use
a different naming convention.
* New switch --noassert: Omits assertions from .class files (not
recommended for normal development, but provided to allow you to do
-source 1.4 -target 1.3).
* Now supports -target 1.4.2 (compatible with javac, no changes from
-target 1.4 in emitted code).

Warnings are given for some common violations of Joshua Bloch's book
"Effective Java."  Error text has been improved for method calls, to
list the parameter types the compiler is trying to match.  Error text
on duplicate declarations tries harder to list the original
declaration.

The identifier `enum' will become a keyword once -source 1.5 is
implemented (JDK 1.5: addition of generics (JSR 14); attributes (JSR
175); autoboxing, enhanced for loop, enums, static import, and varargs
(JSR 201); and enhanced .class files (JSR 202)).  Therefore, the
compiler now warns where it is used as an identifier.

The check for method ambiguity no longer looks at the type that
declared each method.  Code that once caused an ambiguous method error
is now legal, per Sun bug 4761586:
class A {
  void m(byte b) {}
}
class B extends A {
  void m(int i) {}
  void foo(byte b) {
    m(b); // now calls inherited A.m(byte), rather than ambiguous
  }
}

Blank finals used inside a local class must be definitely assigned
before the class declaration, rather than simply before all calls to a
constructor of the local class.  For example, this code now causes an
error:
class C {
  void m() {
    final int i;
    class Local { int j = i; } // i has not been assigned before here
    i = 1;
    new Local(); // even though it has been before creating a Local
  }
}

The scope of a local class declaration statement in a switch statement
is corrected to be only the nearest case label (unlike local variable
declarations which remain in scope for the entire switch
statement). This has the following effects:
class D {
  void m(int i) {
    switch (i) {
    case 0:
      class One {}
      class Two {}
      int j;
      int k;
      break;
    case 1:
      // new One(); // now illegal, declaration no longer in scope
      class Two {} // now legal, no conflict with prior declaration
      j = 1; // remains legal as before
      // int k; // remains illegal as before
    }
  }
}

Constant instance variables are now initialized sooner, so that you
cannot view their default 0 value even with reflection.

The statement 'throw null;' is now treated as an unchecked exception,
since it always results in a NullPointerException being thrown. This
also means that throwing null does not make a checked exception catch
clause reachable.

Improved the parser. A few more syntactic errors have been deferred to
semantic errors, in order to give a more helpful message.  The parser
is slightly faster [for those that know parser theory, it is now
LALR(1) instead of LALR(2)].

The compiler now works around a bug in VMs when storing an array into
a multi-dimensional array expression that happened to be null.

Extranious error messages about non zip or jar content in extdirs has
been removed.

As always, minor bug fixes for several bugs in the database.
