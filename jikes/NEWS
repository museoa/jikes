*** Jikes 1.19 was released ???.

The default -source and -target options are now 1.4 (that is, the
assert statement now compiles by default); for the old behavior you
must specify -source 1.3 or -target 1.3 at the command line.

The check for method ambiguity no longer looks at the type that
declared each method.  Code that once caused an ambiguous method error
is now legal, per Sun bug 4761586:
class A {
  void m(byte b) {}
}
class B extends A {
  void m(int i) {}
  void foo(byte b) {
    m(b); // now calls inherited A.m(byte), rather than ambiguous
  }
}

Constant instance variables are now initialized sooner, so that you
cannot view their default 0 value even with reflection.

The statement 'throw null;' is now treated as an unchecked exception,
since it always results in a NullPointerException being thrown. This
also means that throwing null does not make a checked exception catch
clause reachable.
