*** Jikes 1.19 was released ???.

The default -source and -target options are now 1.4 (that is, the
assert statement now compiles by default); for the old behavior you
must specify -source 1.3 or -target 1.3 at the command line.

Constant instance variables are now initialized sooner, so that you
cannot view their default 0 value even with reflection.

FIXME: What other big changes have been added?

*** Jikes 1.18 was released 21 November 2002.

Compilation that encounters syntax errors is more robust.
An assertion failure involving placeholder_type was solved.
Other minor bugs have been fixed.

*** Jikes 1.17 was released 27 September 2002.

The regression with empty if-clauses was fixed.
Inheritance issues and name shadowing were improved.
Package handling was improved somewhat.
Many other bugs were fixed.

NEWS was not properly maintained in prior versions.
