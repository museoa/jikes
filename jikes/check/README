This directory will hold a variety of subdirectories for projects that we will
build as part of a 'make check' cycle. Ideally we will use well known build
versions of these projects, but if that's not possible, well, we'll just have
to deal with the possibility that these test can be broken by forces outside
of our control.

For now the "interface" is for each of these dirs to have a "doit" script to
actually do the test, and a "cleanup" script to, well, cleanup after the fact.

Ideally this would be in Makefile form... but well... it's just too simple to
do these as shell scripts and trying to make them Makefiles just makes my
head hurt. Anyone that can convert these to an equivalent functioning Makefile
that takes "check" and "clean" as input is welcome to do so.
