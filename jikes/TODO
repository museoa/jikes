Get IRIX build support working again.

We need a solution like those for wcslen but for iconv.


Add test cases for the typos in error.cpp that were fixed
just before the release. In fact, it would be nice if we
could generate a test case for every error condition and
test the compiler output.


See if the -fhonor-std flag helps with the namespace
problems with g++.

Check into the fix for bug 102, we reverted it because of
crashes, but it would be nice to look into the fix again.


Move the jikes/project/index.html file from the
webserver into the CVS. We need to be able to
track changes.


Drop OLDCSO support from Jikes.


Why are catching of exceptions that are not thrown
treated as warnings? I thought these would be errors.


Make sure the java.g file is included in the .tar ball.
It seems this did not happen for 1.12.
