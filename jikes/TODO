Get IRIX build support working again.

We need a solution like those for wcslen but for iconv.


Add test cases for the typos in error.cpp that were fixed
just before the release. In fact, it would be nice if we
could generate a test case for every error condition and
test the compiler output.


See if the -fhonor-std flag helps with the namespace
problems with g++.

Check into the fix for bug 102, we reverted it because of
crashes, but it would be nice to look into the fix again.
