If you are contributing code to the Jikes project,
please read this file.


Autotools based build system:

If you modify any of the files used by the autotools build
process (Makefile.am, configure.in, and so on), you will
need to run the ./autogen.sh script to generate a new
./configure script. The autogen.sh requires that you
have the CVS versions of autoconf and automake installed.
You can not use the 2.13 release of autoconf.

The java.g file:

Note that some of the files in Jikes are machine-generated.
Any changes that require edits to the file src/java.g will
also require you to obtain a copy of the Jikes Parser
Generator (jikespg).


Rules to Live By:

Never allocate objects on the stack. Always allocate
objects using the new operator, even if the object
will only be used inside a function. Objects
allocated on the stack can become corrupted and
take the stack along with it, making debugging
very difficult.


Before you send in that patch:

Patches to the Jikes compiler should be accompanied
by test cases for Jacks, the automated regression
test suite used by the Jikes project. The Jacks
cvs module is "jacks", the CVSROOT is the same
as the one used by Jikes.



Some handy CXXFLAGS you may want to use g++:

-Wall : Print all warnings

-Weffc++ : Warn based on Effective C++ guidelines

-pedantic : Be even more strict than -Wall

-Wshadow : Warn when a local variable shadows another local variable. 

-fno-rtti : Disable runtime type identification (not currently used)

-fno-exceptions : Disable exception support (not currently used)

-Wold-style-cast : Warn on C style casts

-fhonor-std : Try harder to honor C++ standards.

-ggdb : Write debug info with gdb in mind

-static : create a statically linked binary

CXXFLAGS='-Wall -Weffc++ -pedantic -Wshadow -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions -ggdb'
