<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 24 September 1999</h2>

<h3 align=center>Glenn Kasten joins Jikes Project Core Team</h3>

The Jikes Core Team is pleased to announce that Glenn Kasten has
accepted our invitation to join the team.

<h3 align=center>Jikes on the move</h3>
Most of the files have been copied over to our new home at 
<a href="http://ibm.com/developerworks/opensource">ibm.com/developerworks/opensource</a>,
including development and stable versions. I have started a new Jikes News file there.
<p>I hope to see you over at developerworks; look there for news of further developments.
The above URL is for the main entry point; the Jikes Project pages, similar in structure to our current pages,
can be found at

<h3 align=center>Problems re <code>-d</code>, <code>-depend</code> <code>+F</code></h3>

To those who have encountered problems using the above options, or
who have followed the recent mail on the Jikes lists about this
topic, I have started a (hopefully) short-term project -- in our new
home -- to sort this out.  The underlying issue that needs to be
resolved is the classpath search order, so I have named it CSO:

<h3 align=center>FAQ explanation of <code>+F</code> and <code>-depend</code> revised</h3>
The FAQ (<code>jikes.htm</code>) has been revised to include an expanded
explanation of the <code>+F</code> and </code>-depend</code> options. 

<p>The revised version is currently only available via our Research
web site, as we are moving the CVS tree over to our new home.

<h3 align=center><code>google.com</code> now available, good job for Jikes</h3>

<code>Slashdot</code> just ran a story that the new search-engine
<code>google.com</code> is now officially up. It seems to do a pretty
good job for Jikes.

<h3 align=center>Single multi-tier application using almost every version of Jikes</h3>
Brad Smith recently posted the following note to the Jikes alphaWorks' discussion area.
It's the first time I've seen mention a single project that was using Jikes on so many platforms,
and using so many versions of Jikes at once:
<blockquote>
We are designing and building a multi-tier java application in which we use
Jikes to compiled the sources. We recently ran into a problem that had us
baffled for several weeks but we finally solved last thursday.
<p>
Our development group uses NT, Windows 95, Linux and OS/2 PCs. We test the
middle tier components on OS/2 and AIX. Client components run mainly on
Windows 95, but we also test on Linux and OS/2 and NT.
<p>
The application would work smoothly on most of the developer's systems but
when we moved the middle tier to AIX, some clients were have problems with
messaging classes that were being shipped from the server to the client and
generating exceptions. We could not isolate the problem. When it did show up,
it was always there, but when it would show up was baffling.
<p>
Finally at the 11th hour before user training we found the problem: different
versions of Jikes were being used for different OS's and/or client vs middle
tier components. Once we used the same Jikes compiler across the board the
problem went away. Some of us had 0.55, other 1.02. 
<p>
So, if you are having unusual problems with distributed applications, double
check to make sure the test code is all built with the same version of Jikes.
<p>
Jikes has been and continues to be a very useful and important tool. This is
just a caution based on our experience.

<h3 align=center><code>alt.sysadmin.recovery</code> thread re Jikes' error recovery and reporting</h3>

I recently discovered, courtesy of <code>deja.com</code>, the
following discussion about Jikes' error recovery and reporting. When
I showed it to Philippe, he remarked the main motivation for the
spell-checking is to help users who have forgotten the convention of
identifier names with an initial lower case letter; for example, to
note that <code>ToString</code> should be <code>toString</code>

I've only seen two compilers that attempt to do that.
 
One of them I used 20 years ago, and it was called "SP/K", and it was
a subset of PL/1.  Every attempt it made to "fix" the compiler errors
was guaranteed to cause billions more compilation errors further on.
Once it made an attempt to "fix" something, you couldn't trust any
more compiler messages in the rest of the file, because most of them
were caused by the "fix". 
 
The second one is "jikes", the hyperfast java compiler from IBM.  It
only attempts a fix when it's something trivial like a missing
semi-colon, and it does a pretty good job of figuring out where it
belongs.  An even cooler feature is when it says something like "I
see you've used an undeclared variable `foob' on line 227.  There is
a declared variable `food', maybe that's what you intended."  The
amount of effort it goes through to find similar variables and
methods is startling.

ah, I used sp/k briefly, at about that time... say no more...

I switched to real pl/1 quickly, although I then had to do without
the "picture" formatting option (like BASIC's "PRINT USING").. I
remember sitting in the corner between keypunches with a pl/1 manual
borrowed from the consultants' desk trying to find its analogue,
before I concluded it was just not available... ok I'll admit I
learned pl/1 via sp/k, and so did you it sounds like...
 
>There is a declared variable `food',
 
You seem to think this is cool, but I think it's stupid.
 
Mostly I think that this whole concept of trying to compile what the
user might have meant instead of what they said is obsolete.  The
only use for error recovery these days is to be able to give people
the full list of error messages in one go, or at least a big chunk of
them so that they don't have to type "make" once per error however
minor.  So "undeclared variable" suffices in this case, and move on,
and stop trying to generate code because you're going to exit with a
fatal error anyway.
 
In the old days where that missing semicolon meant that after you
retyped the punch card you had to submit your deck and wait another
two hours (or even ten minutes), the "guessing" behaviour got us
something.  I'm astonished that a modern compiler does it, although
given that a modern compiler does do it I'm not astonished that it's
something from IBM, which is not a company known for moving with the
times.

Ah, but unlike sp/k jikes doesn't then try and generate code with
it's attempted fixups, it just generates messages.  The second thing
I mentioned (finding close but not quite variable names) is just part
of the diagnostic message, it doesn't actually try and compile with
whatever it guessed.  Which is fine, because if it did, you know that
would lead to 450 billion cascading messages because the types didn't
match, etc.

<h3 align=center>Ken Coar joins Core Team</h3>
The Jikes Core Team is pleased to announce that Ken Coar has accepted
our invitation to join the team.

<h3 align=center>New Development Version, v1.06</h3>
<ul>Problem Reports Resolved:
<li>489 segfault on Linux
<li>490 bridge over troubled waters
<li>491 nested constructor error
</ul>

<p>This version adds the option <code>-Xdepend</code>. It does the same 
thing as <code>-depend</code>, and was added for 1.2 JDK compatibility.

<p>
A bug uncovered navigating the troubled waters of PR 490 was of
sufficient severity to justify the release of a new version. We
also recently noted some erratic behavior using incremental
compilation, and so have temporarily disabled the '++' option 
while we sort things out.

<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 16 September 1999</h2>
<h3 align=center>Jikes Project to move to developerWorks</h3>

IBM is providing a new home for its software licensed under the IBM
Public License, <a href="http://ibm.com/developerworks/opensource">
http://ibm.com/developerworks/opensource</a>, and hopes to encourage
increased participation in its open-source projects by providing
increased authority, resources, responsibility and support to companies
and individuals interested in collaborative development.

<p>
Though the new developerWorks open-source section will not be
officially announced for a couple of weeks, we are announcing it now
to the Jikes community -- to let you know what's going on, and to ask
for your help, patience and understanding while we work with the
developerWorks staff to bring up the Jikes portion of the site.
We would appreciate your discretion about spreading the news, as we
don't wish to steal any of the thunder that is undoubtedly being
planned by our PR people for the formal announcement.

<p>
The Jikes Project will be managed by the Core Team, which will be
responsible for the CVS source tree and other content of the Jikes
Project section of developerWorks. The current members are 
<a HREF="mailto:charles@watson.ibm.com">Philippe Charles</a>,
<a HREF="mailto:mernst@cs.washington.edu">Michael Ernst</a>,
<a HREF="mailto:shields@watson.ibm.com">David Shields</a>
and <a HREF="mailto:lord@crocodile.org">Vadim Zaliva</a>. The Core Team
elects Contributors and new members of the Core Team.

<p>
The project's new site will provide:
<ul>
<li>write-access to the CVS tree for the Core Team and Contributors,
<li>write-access via secure ftp for the Core Team and Contributors so they
can update the project's web content,
<li>read-only access to the CVS tree to all via the web using CVSWeb,
<li><a href="http://jitterbug.samba.org">JitterBug</a> 
bug report/tracking system,
<li>mail lists.
</ul>
Other features under consideration include anonymous ftp and a
discussion capability.

<p>
Our "public address" -- the one to be used in documentation and in
informal discussion -- will be "Jikes Project at
http://ibm.com/developerworks/opensource".  However, we will not be
using the primary developerWorks' server, but will share a separate
Linux-based machine with the other open-source projects.  The main
page URL is
<a href="http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/index.html">
http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/index.html</a>
and the URL for the project-owned pages is 
<a href="http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/project/">
http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/project/</a>.
I'm told these URLs should appear soon; as soon as they do, we will
start a "News" section there about the transition process.

<p>
You should continue to use our currrent site 
(<a href="http://ibm.com/research/jikes">http://ibm.com/research/jikes)</a>
to obtain news, to download files, and to report bugs -- we don't
want to move all the work over until everything is in place. We plan
no further releases until the CVS tree has been moved, unless a real
"show-stopper" bug surfaces.

<h3 align=center>New Development Version, v1.05</h3>
<p>Problem Report Resolved:
<ul>
<li>484 another verify error in 1.01

The URL's in the documentation files have been changed to point 
to developerworks.

<h3 align=center>New Development Version, v1.05</h3>
<p>Problem Reports Resolved:
<ul>
<li>484 another verify error in 1.01
</ul>

The URL's in the documentation files have been changed to point 
to developerworks.  There is also a revised man page 
(something I forgot to mention in the v1.04 release note).
<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 14 September 1999</h2>
<h3 align=center>New Development Version, v1.04</h3>
<p>Problem Reports Resolved:
<ul>
<li>434 line number wrong in exception traceback
<li>459 more problems with try/catch
<li>460 problems with line number for while statement
<li>465 use of super from inner classes
<li>469 possible bug with nested try/catch
<li>474 protected caution -- inappropriate for super class static method
<li>476 misrepresenting imports
<li>480 spurious error message
</ul>

Three problem reports (462, 463, 468) that suggested better error
messages for certain syntax errors have been closed out, as Jikes
uses tables generated by the Jikes Parser Generator to detect and
report syntax errors, and it is not possible to customize
syntax-related error messages.

<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 10 September 1999</h2>
<h3 align=center>New Development Version, v1.03</h3>
<p>Problem Reports Resolved:

<li>481 verify error in 1.01
<li>484 array clone problem
</ul>

<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 1 September 1999</h2>
<h3 align=center>New Development Version, v1.02</h3>
<p>Problem Reports Resolved:
<ul>
<li>478 error compiling java/lang/Object
<li>479 Jikes 1.01 crashes due to bad delete[]
</ul>
<p>This version also
includes a new version of the FAQ (<code>jikes.htm</code>).
A "Provides: jikes" entry has been added to <code>jikes.spec</code>, at the suggestion of 
<a href="mailto:shane@raleigh.ibm.com">Shane Owenby</a>, based on a recent
discussion in the <code>rpm</code> mailing list.

<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 25 August 1999</h2>

<h3 align=center>New Development Version, v1.01</h3>
<p>Problem Reports Resolved:
<ul>
<li>457 verification error with try/catch
<li>466 Jikes wrongly calls stat('/') if fully-specified directory in classpath
<li>467 method "null" bug
<li>471 problem with null constant and reachability
</ul>
This version also
<ul>
<li>fixes some problems with <code>clone()</code>.
<li>detects more cases where the <code>IINC</code> opcode can be used.
<li>provides better checking for cases where <code>WIDE</code>
instruction is needed
<li>provides a cleaner interface for tracking methods from the
standard library that may need to be be referenced, such as those
needed for string concatenation.
<li>uses a new scheme to track directories used in the classpath, one
which may fix some of the problems reported with <code>-d</code>.
<li>cleans up the code for 64-bit arithmetic, and does better job
handling divides by zero.
</ul>
<h3 align=center>Why V1.01?</h3>

<p>Alert readers will note that this version is <code>v1.01</code>
and not the <code>v0.56</code> that would be expected. We decided
that, having put out more than 50 releases since late 1996, this was
a good time to end the "early test phase".

<h3 align=center>Changes to build process, downloads</h3>

I had need lately to learn more about <code>RPM</code> (I found
Henner Zeller's spec file very helpful).  This led to a review of the
current build/download process, and has resulted in the following
changes:

<ul>
<li>We will now provide both <code>RPM</code> (RedHat 5.2, glibc,
intel) and <code>SRPM</code> files for downloading. Note that these files
have suffix <code>.bin</code> appended, as our servers have already reserved the file type
<code>.rpm</code> for RealAudio files.
<li>Added file <code>news.htm</code> based on the "Jikes News"
document, and included it in the list of documentation files.
<li>Renamed the <code>README.TXT</code> files to be just <code>README</code>.
<li>Renamed former <code>Makefile</code> to <code>Makefile.hand</code> since
running <code>./configure</code> creates a file <code>Makefile</code>.
</ul>

<h3 align=center>Good news re Jikes license and Debian</h3>
<p>The following is from <a href="mailto:whig@by.net">Mike Goldman</a>, a member of the
Debian team, in response to my query about their reaction to the new license:
<blockquote>
<p>
The consensus opinion seems to be that the new Jikes license is
DFSG-compliant, and consequently it is planned that Jikes *will* ship in the main
Debian distribution (rather than contrib or non-free).  It is already in the main
"potato" archive.  There has been some concern expressed that Jikes is
"incompatible" with the GPL (the GNU "General Public License") -- that is, GPL
source cannot be legally combined with Jikes source -- but that is not in and of
itself fatal.

<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 28 July 1999</h2>
<h3 align=center>New Development Version, v0.55</h3>
<p>Problem Reports Resolved:
<ul>
<li>437 problem with AbstractMethod exception
<li>443 virtual methods from inner classes
<li>446 problem with SwingWorker
<li>449 inner class can't call overriden protected method
<li>453 problem with IncompatibleClassChangeError

<li>456 problem with protected inner classes of superclasses in a different package
</ul>

<h3 align=center>New files <code>segment.cpp</code> and <code>segment.h</code></h3>
<p>This version includes two new files; the build-related files have been updated. If you are using your own makefile
then you will have to make the corresponding additions. These files support new function that does a better job avoiding
redundant entries in the constant pool.

<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 26 July 1999</h2>

<li>441 constructor problem with anonymous class
<li>442 interface and toString; static calls
<li>445 constructor isn't called
<li>447 problem with protected method
</ul>
<p>This version includes revised code generation for <code>try/catch/finally</code> that more closely 
follows the examples and description in the Java Virtual Machine Specification. Previous versions of Jikes generated
bytecode that in some cases included instructions that were unreachable. Even though they passed verification
on most platforms, problems with verification on the Solaris platform suggested a careful revision was in
order.

<h3 align=center>Files <code>bool.h</code> and <code>unicode.h</code> removed</h3>
<p>These files are no longer needed, and the build-related files have been updated. If you are using your own makefile
then you will have to remove any references to <code>bool.h</code> or <code>unicode.h</code>.

<h3 align=center>Support for option <code>-Xstdout</code></h3>
Jikes now recognizes the option <code>-Xstdout</code> to request
that error messages be written to the standard output file; by
default they are now written to the standard error file.

<h3 align=center>RPM file for Jikes</h3>
<a href="mailto:zeller@stud.fh-heilbronn.de">Henner Zeller</a> has made available
<a href="http://linux.fh-heilbronn.de/~zeller/download/jikes/">RPM file for Jikes Relocatable</a>.
We have added his file <code>jikes.spec</code> to the set of source
files to help those wishing to build their own RPM versions.

<h3 align=center>Auto-detect for <code>bool</code> when compiling Jikes</h3>
This version includes a patch 
from <a href="mailto:larry.gensch@digital.com">Larry Gensch</a>
who wrote:
"I've added a test in your configure.in script in jikes-052 to
auto-detect the presence of the "bool" keyword (ANSI C++)."


<h3 align=center>Illegality of <code>"class C implements C.I"</code></h3>
We recently filed 
<a href="http://domino.watson.ibm.com/syssftpr/JavaTech/Jikes.nsf/Named/SunQuery31">
Query #31 to Sun</a>. It relates in part to the legality of
the following construct found in some versions of <code>swing</code>:
<pre>
  class C implements C.I {

  ...
  }

Sun's response agrees with our interpretation that this usage is illegal.

<h3 align=center>Jikes at LinuxExpo</h3>

<p>I represented Jikes in the IBM booth at the just-concluded
LinuxExpo in Raleigh, NC. Several people expressed interest in using
Jikes once they saw its speed. One of the Java managers
from SGI mentioned they had ported Jikes as soon as the source came
out; the only complaint from their developers was that they now had less time
for coffee breaks.

<p>I gave two talks (one on the technical track, another on
the business track) with emphasis on our experiences after
releasing the source.  About 70 people attended the first talk, about
30 the second.

<p>I understand about 4000 people attended the Expo. Rob Malda of
Slashdot stopped by to chat, and mentioned that IBM's booth was
bigger than the <em>entire</em> exhibit area at last year's expo.

<h3 align=center>Another Jikes for Amiga</h3>

<p><a href="mailto:tim@ramjam.u-net.com">Tim Corringham</a> writes
(24 May 1999) that he is provoding binary versions for another Amiga
version, this one using Unix style file notation, and requiring the
<code>ixemul</code> Unix compatibility library. Details in the Ports
Section.

<h3 align=center>Jikes for SCO UnixWare 7</h3>

<p><a href="mailto:Jerry.Heyman@tivoli.com">Jerry Heyman</a> writes
(27 May 99): that SCO is providing a version for UnixWare 7
(currently v0.41). Details in the Ports section.

<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 9 May 1999</h2>
<h3 align=center>New Development Version, v0.50</h3>

<p>This version consists mainly of changes to the code generator, as
what began as a modest review turned into a major "spring cleaning".
The code generator was recomputing some information that had already
been computed by the front-end, and had otherwise not been updated to
reflect many of the front-end changes recently put in place. There
may be some regressions since we have touched parts of the code that
have been stable for some time.

<p>There are also a couple of bug fixes, consisting of some improved error messages, and a fix for a bad
assert in <code>ast.h</code> that was recently reported.

<h3 align=center>Version number now part of download file name for Jikes compiler</h3>

<p>In response to several user requests, the file names for downloading the 
compiler now include the version number: <code>jikes-050_tar.gz</code>, 
etc. We will put version numbers on file names for <code>jikestst</code> 
and <code>jikespg</code> when they are next updated.

<h3 align=center>Jikes for Amiga</h3>

<p>Kriton Kyrimis is now producing binaries of Jikes for Amiga; see
the "Ports" section for details.

<h3 align=center>Jikes at LinuxExpo in Raleigh, May 18-22</h3>

<p>Jikes will be part of the IBM presence at the <a
href="http://linuxexpo.org">Linux Expo</a> at the Raleigh Convention
Center in Raleigh, NC, May 20-22. I will be at the IBM Booth, and
will also give a talk on our experience starting and running the
Jikes project, and plan to emphasize what has happened since we released
the source in December, 1998.  I would like to include user feedback
in the talk, as noted below.

<h3 align=center>Request for User Feedback</h3>

<p>We have started a section 
<a href="http://www.domino.watson.ibm.com/syssftpr/JavaTech/Jikes.nsf/Feedback">
Feedback</a> in the Jikes Discussion Database where you can make comments and suggestions about the
Jikes Project.  Suggestions on how we can do a better job are especially
welcome.

<p>We plan to include a summary of the comments received in the talk to
be given at LinuxExpo.

<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 16 April 1999</h2>
<h3 align=center>New Development Version, v0.49</h3>

<p>This version fixes a bug (reported on jikes-bugs on 14 April) related to calling
a private method in an enclosing class that was introduced in v0.48.


<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 14 April 1999</h2>
<h3 align=center>New Development Version, v0.48</h3>
<ul>
<li>Several bug fixes.</li>
<li>Revised to use static methods to access private fields and methods of enclosing types</li>
<li>Better support for "international" character sets</li>
<li>Revised format for dependence report (<code>+M=filename</code>)
</ul>

<p>Bill Pugh of the University of Maryland pointed out that Jikes
should use static methods to enable access to private fields and
methods of enclosing types, and Jikes now generates static methods.

<p>Several readers sent in problem reports related to the handling of
"international" characters in the input source, and included
examples that demonstrated the problem was in a faulty table used to
represent the classification of Unicode characters. Instead of trying
to interpret the various descriptions of Java's interpretation of
Unicode, we have added a new program <code>gencode.java</code> that
probes the classification used by the Java library and writes
out the source for files <code>code.h</code> and <code>code.cpp</code>.
We obtained the same results running Sun's reference VM for Windows for JDK versions 1.1.6
and 1.2.

<p>This work also uncovered a problem in the handling of these
characters for Solaris Sparc. Turns out that the type <code>wchar_t</code> was
declared as a <code>long</code> and when a <code>char</code> value (even <code>unsigned char</code>)
was copied to a <code>wchar_t</code>, it was sign-extended. This problem used to cause Jikes to crash
on some inputs.

<h3 align=center>New option <code>+M=filename</code> to list direct dependences</h3>

<p>Jikes now supports a new form of the <code>+M</code> option, 
<code>+M=filename</code>, to request a direct dependence report be written
to the specified file. Each clause begins with a line of the form

<pre>
    file_specification : class_name
</pre>

which gives the file containg the definition of a class. The file
specification is either the name of a file or the name of a <code>jar</code> or
<code>zip</code> file followed by the name of a member of the file enclosed in
parentheses.


<p>A clause may be followed by zero or more lines containing the names
of classes directly referenced by the class; each such line begins with
whitespace.  A reference introduced as the result of referencing the
value of a static final constant is preceded by an exclamation point
(!).

<p>Class names are given in the internal form for a fully qualified
name used by the Java virtual machine (section 4.2 of the JVM
specification).

<p>This option represents our first attempt to answer a number of
requests to provide a report of the dependence information in a form
other than a Makefile, and is based in part on recent discussions
with Roger Hoover of NaturalBridge. Note that the format may change, as this is
a work in progress.

<p>Our intent is to provide a format suitable for writing tools that analyze dependence, and not to
provide the tools as part of the compiler itself.


<h3 align=center>Jikes for Linux Power PC</h3>

<p>Keith Clayton is now producing binaries of Jikes for Power PC. The
URL can be found in the "Ports" section.


<h3 align=center>Status, Plans </h3>

<p>We have still not had time to add all the 1.2-related command-line
options; look for them in the next version.

<p>We are still working through the 1.2 JCK (Java Compatibility Kit)
tests. There remain a small number of discrepancies in the results
that need to be sorted out. We also hope to have this done by the
next release.

<p>We have fallen behind responding to some of the recent mail and
bug reports while getting this version ready, and plan to deal with
the backlog as soon as we work through the 1.2 tests.

<h3 align=center>Building Jikes with Microsoft's C++ compiler</h3>

<p> We have cautioned in the past about using Microsoft's compiler to
build Jikes since we had noted some different results in some of the
floating-point arithmetic tests in version 1.1.4 of Sun's JCK.  We
recently re-ran these tests using a version of Jikes compiled with
version 6.0 of Microsoft's Visual C++ compiler, and found that while
this version failed one test that passed using our current (IBM)
compiler, it also passed another test that failed when using Jikes
built using the IBM C++ compiler. Both problems were in the fringe
area of floating-point support. In any event, we no longer see any
reason not to use VC++ to compile Jikes.

<p>We will also review the use of Microsoft's compiler after
completing the review of 1.2 test results, as this version of the JCK
contains a large amount (about 200,000 lines) of tests of
floating-point arithmetic.

<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 16 March 1999</h2>

<h3 align=center>New Stable Version, v0.47</h3>

<p>We have updated the stable version on alphaworks Jikes to v0.47.
Note that the URL for Jikes on alphaworks is now 
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/jikes">
http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/jikes</a>

<p>We're almost done adding the 1.2-related changes to Jikes. 
Remaining work includes some new options, and some outstanding bug fixes; we expect to put this out soon.

<h3 align=center>Improved access to CVS tree</h3>

<p>Ken Coar is helping to provide better access to the CVS source
tree. We plan to make available a mailing list whose subscribers
will receive an e-mail in "patch" form for each source commit as it
is made, and plan also to offer "cvsweb" access, in the same form as
used by the Apache group; see for example
<a href="http://www.apache.org/websrc/cvsweb.cgi">Apache cvsweb server</a>

<p>We have also dropped the <code>latest-cvsjikes_tar.gz</code> file,
as we have found it more convenient and useful to provide new
versions in both binary and source form, rather than to provide just
a snapshot of the CVS tree, in a form only useful to those with CVS
and willing to compile the source.


<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 19 February 1999</h2>
<h3 align=center>Development V0.44 available</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bug fixes, including one for the problem using Swing reported by a number of users.</li>

<li>The <code>+$</code> option has been dropped.</li>
<li>The <code>+V</code> option is now <code>+P</code> (pedantic).</li>
<li>Improved Makefile support for HP-UX/gcc, FreeBSD.</li>
<li>New file <code>contrib.htm</code> to (eventually) include list of contributors to the code.</li>
</ul>



<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 12 February 1999</h2>

<h3 align=center>V0.43 available, adds support for Java 1.2</h3>

<p>Version 0.43 supports the Java 1.2 (aka Java 2) language changes.

<h3 align=center>"Development" and "Stable" versions</h3>

<p>Beginning with this release, we will distinguish the "development"
version of Jikes from a "stable" version. We will first publish
development versions on our Research web site, and will promote a
version to stable status by publishing it on the alphaworks site only
after it has survived a few days of use in the field.

<p>If you are just interested in using Jikes to compile your program
then you should 
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/formula/jikes">Download the stable
version</a>. We will announce a new stable version only after
alphaWorks has published it, via our mailing lists; you can subscribe
via
<pre>
    echo subscribe | mail jikes-announce-request@watson.ibm.com
</pre>

<p>We will also discontinue publishing the source for the test suite and
parser generator at alphaWorks, and only provide it from the Research
site.

<p>If you wish to live on the "bleeding edge" and work with
development versions as they appear, then you should 
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/research/jikes/download">
Download the development version</a>.

You should also follow the relevant mail lists:
<pre>
    echo subscribe | mail jikes-announce-request@watson.ibm.com
    echo subscribe | mail jikes-request@watson.ibm.com
    echo subscribe | mail jikes-bugs-request@watson.ibm.com
    echo subscribe | mail jikes-patches-request@watson.ibm.com
</pre>


<h3 align=center>Ports for OS/2, FreeBSD available</h3>
<p>The Ports section now has links to these new distributions.

<h3 align=center>Jikes for Solaris</h3>
<p>We currently provide a binary version for Solaris Sparc built using IBM's C++ compiler.

<p>We understand some users working with the source use Sun's
compiler while others use gcc or egcs.  We have gotten a number of
e-mails and patches related to the Solaris version, and have updated
the Makefile. We would like to clear up any outstanding issues soon
and ask our Solaris users to try to build the compiler on their
system and report any problems.

<p>Note that some users have reported problems relating to use of
"IFDIR", etc. If you have similar problems review file
<code>config.h</code> especially the section re
<code>STAT_POSIX</code> near the start, as you may need to specify
<code>-DSTAT_POSIX</code> in the Makefile.

<p>We would also appreciate a volunteer willing to build binary
versions for Solaris Intel and publish them on the web. Let us know
if you are interested and we will add the URL to the Ports section.

<h3 align=center>What is the Jikes Discussion Database? When do I need to use it?</h3>

<p>From time to time you may see mention of the "Jikes Discussion
Database", usually as part of a note about a problem report.

<p>We started the database about one year ago. It's a Lotus Notes
Database, published to the web using Lotus Domino. You can access it
via
<a href="http://domino.watson.ibm.com/syssftpr/JavaTech/Jikes.nsf">Jikes Discussion Database</a>.
There is also a link to it on the main Jikes page at Research.

<p> It was our main vehicle for communicating with our users before
releasing the source, and contains problem reports, suggestions,
comments, e-mail with Sun, etc.


<p>Though we now publish files and news on our web site, we continue
to use the Database for the following:
<ul>
<li>Filing problem reports and tracking their status.</li>
<li>Publishing queries to Sun about the language specification, and Sun's responses.</li>
<li>Occasional publication of pre-release source and binaries for checking out a bug
fix before we put up a new version.</li>
</ul>

<p>The user interface leaves much to be desired. You will be presented with an initial page
giving instructions. Click on "By Topic" to proceed.

<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 4 February 1999</h2>
<h3 align=center>Downloads now available from Jikes Web Page</h3>

<p>We will now publish new releases first on our web page. New
releases will include a snapshot of the CVS source tree at the time
of the release, flattened copies in "zip" and "gzip" form of the
sources for those who just want to work with particular parts or who
don't have CVS, and binaries that we have built from the sources.
Part of building a release is running the tests available to us.

<h3 align=center>"Latest CVS snapshot" section added</h3>

<p>We will try to publish snapshots of the CVS source tree at
frequent intervals. Note that we make no promises about the snapshots
-- the compiler might not even compile, we might not have done any
testing, etc.

<h3 align=center>Source for Jikes Parser Generator</h3>The source for the Jikes
Parser Generator Source is now available in the CVS source tree. It
is not included in the v0.42 snapshot (which we have already
prepared). It is included in the initial "latest" snapshot. 


<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 2 February 1999</h2>

<h3 align=center>Revised license; separation of compiler source and test suite</h3>

<p>We are now using a revised license that we believe
answers many of the objections raised to the license released in
December, though we wouldn't be surprised to see more objections
raised about the "termination" clause. We are now using the same
language for "termination" as the SecureMailer source release
(available from alphaWorks).  As always, address questions and
comments about licensing issues to the mail list
<code>jikes-license@watson.ibm.com</code>. You must subscribe before
you can post; instructions on subscribing can be found on the Jikes home page.

<p>Since we anticipate that the compiler source and test suite source
will not always be updated at the same time, we have separated them.
This also avoids having the "60 per cent" rule apply to their
aggregation; it now applies to each separately. The same license is
used for each, except for the name: "Jikes Compiler" and "Jikes Test
Suite", respectively. The current release is v0.42 (CVS tag <code>v0-42</code>) for the compiler,
v1.0 (CVS tag <code>v1-0</code>) for the test suite.

<h3 align=center>Clarification of license terms for binary distributions</h3>

<p>Several users noted that the binaries on alphaWorks were still
governed by the standard alphaWorks license, one that does not allow
commercial use and expires after 90 days. We now use the same license
for binary distributions as for the source, since after all our
binary distributions are just a redistribution of the source in
binary form.

<h3 align=center>Version v0.42</h3>

<p>We have released a new version of the compiler. This includes a
number of bug fixes:
, for Problem Reports 270, 297, 298, 300, 302,
304, 306, 308, 309, 311, 312, 313, 315, 320, 321, 324, 326, 331, and 335.
<p>We are continuing to work through outstanding problem reports, and
hope to catch up with the backlog soon. At that point we will try to
bring the compiler into increased conformance with some of the
language changes introduced in the 1.2 (aka Java 2) release of Sun's
JDK.

<p>We have revised the FAQ, merging in the material formerly in 
<code>jikesfaq.htm</code> (the FAQ that accompanied the binary
release) and <code>jikesos.htm</code> (the FAQ distributed with
original source release) into a new file <code>jikes.htm</code>.
Please be sure to read it, especially if you encounter problems with
<code>CLASSPATH</code> settings.

<h3 align=center>CVS source tree</h3>

<p>We have started maintaining the source using CVS. Another group at
Research is setting up a CVS server machine, and we hope to use that
to publish the CVS tree when the machine becomes available.  In the
interim, we will publish snapshots of the CVS tree in the Jikes
Discussion Database.

<h3 align=center>Jikes at LinuxWorld Expo</h3>

<p>Jikes will be part of the IBM presence at the LinuxWorld Expo at
the San Jose Convention Center in San Jose, CA, March 2-4.  I'll pack
the CVS tree in my suitcase and set up shop in the IBM booth. Lacking anything
else to do, and if no progress has been made, I intend to work on
"-deprecated" support and better reporting of dependence info. Hope
to see you there. Two of my fellow contributors, Glenn Kasten and Vadim
Zaliva, should be there some of the time.

<h3 align=center>Ports</h3>

<p>We have started a section
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/research/jikes/ports.htm">Ports</a> to
describe known ports of Jikes.

<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 23 December 1998</h2>

<p>Work continues on setting up the mailing lists. We hope to have
them up next week.

<p>I believe I have caught up with the backlog of bug reports sent to
me via e-mail, and have made about 30 new entries in the Jikes
Discussion Database in the last two days. I didn't bother to review
them all (I'm officially on vacation) but did copy them all over.
Some duplicate prior entries, and some may have been fixed in v0.41,
but I thought it best just to post them all for the sake of
completeness, so we can sort out the proper disposition later.

<p>I have started "Contributors" section, and have posted first cut
on our web page. Some of the information is incomplete; I hope to
have all the details soon.

<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 15 December 1998</h2>
<h3 align=center>Patience Please -- we need some rest</h3>

<p>The release of the Jikes source has met with an enthusiastic
reception. We are very happy about this and look forward to working
together actively with our new-found co-developers. We sense everyone
is eager to get to work, but we ask your patience.

<p>First, please remember there are only the two of us -- Philippe
and myself. We have been working non-stop since early December 1997.
The only vacation we took this year was about eight days in early
August. I spent that time on the Maine coast; I also spent at least
two hours a night reading the comments from Slashdot readers on the
issue "Should IBM release the source for Jikes?", preparing a summary
of the comments, and starting the proposal to management to release
the source. While on his vacation, Philippe spent several hours a day in the Wellfleet
public library adding a cache-based file/directory management system;
one result of this was to reduce the time needed to compile
a 400,000 line subset of San Francisco from 1500+ seconds to 110
seconds on a 150Mhz Pentium laptop running Win95.

<p>I also got quite stressed out getting the source out in time. We
didn't get the final wording of the license until Friday noon, just
three days before launch. I spent that weekend writing the FAQ and
web-site contents, and packaging the files (thanks to Nelson Minar
for uncovering a bug in the ZIP version late Sunday evening). Indeed,
a couple of weeks ago I had the following exchange with my daughter
Jennifer as I was driving her to school:

<blockquote>
Dave: I probably have to go into work this Saturday, and perhaps Sunday as well.
<br>
Jennifer: Dad, are Saturday and Sunday regular work days at IBM?
<br>
Dave: (gulp)
</blockquote>

When I related this incident to a senior manager, he said something
along the lines of "Not a bad idea!".  I'm still recovering,
and do need some rest, but promise to be eager to go in the new year.

<p>Philippe is also getting some rest, and says he probably won't be
hacking on the code. This is good news, as I feared he would come
back from vacation with several thousand lines of diff's for the
source.  So we will probably all be able to start work with source
quite close to that first released once the licensing issues are
sorted out.

<h3 align=center>Thanks for the offers, but ...</h3>

<p>One of the arguments we put forth for releasing the Jikes source
was that it would help establish a precedent for IBM Research, and
also provide useful experience in what is needed to set up a
source-based development site and how to run it. Several people and
groups have made generous offers to run the mailing lists, provide
CVS support, etc. However, it's important that we learn to do it
ourselves, even it means some delay to our eager developers chafing
at the bit to get hacking.

<p>We will use CVS to maintain the source, and will make available
the full source tree in read-only mode.  Since IBM Research is still
actively involved, only Philippe or I will make actual changes,
though we will make every effort to include voluntary user
contributions exactly as received, with credit given where credit is
due.

<p>I asked Vadim about problem-reporting systems. He says he has used
Gnats and likes it. So we'll go with that unless a better suggestion
comes in. We hope to have it in place soon.

<h3 align=center>Vadim named "lord of the patches"</h3>

<p>I've asked Vadim Zaliva (lord@crocodile.org) to serve as temporary
"lord of the patches" until we add CVS and ftp support, and he has agreed to
collect patches for Jikes at his website. You can get them via 
<a href="ftp://ftp.crocodile.org/pub/jikes/">Jikes Patches</a>.


<h3 align=center>Yahoo!</h3>
<p>Search for "jikes" at <a href="http://yahoo.com">yahoo</a>. Nice
job, yahoo.

<h3 align=center>LinuxToday</h3>

<p>We thank Dave Whitinger of <a
href="http://linuxtoday.com">LinuxToday</a> for posting some of our
recent news articles, and especially for his posting of Jennifer's
"Shaking Hands" Jikes Masthead. Indeed, he even offered to put it in
their banner queue; Jennifer and I are thrilled -- and very
grateful.</a>

<h2 align=center>Jikes News: 11 December 1998</h2>
<h3 align=center>Phone call with Bruce Perens re Jikes License, Jikes Parser Generator</h3>

<p>I was a participant in a conference call with Bruce Perens
yesterday, along with an IBM manager and attorney.  In the words of
diplomacy, "It was a frank and open exchange". We discussed Bruce's
concerns about the Jikes License and also the question first raised
by the Debian group about releasing the source for the Jikes Parser
Generator.

<p>At the end of the call, Bruce said he would prepare a report on
the call and submit it to slashdot. He graciously offered to send us
a preliminary copy for our review. We declined, as we trusted his
judgment. We also said we would not write our own report, lest
confusion result from two reports trying to relay the same news.

<h3 align=center>Jikes Mailing Lists</h3>

<p>I apologize for the delay in setting up the Jikes mailing lists,
and I appreciate the support of slashdot and LinuxToday in posting my
notes on their sites, so I could honor my pledge to have all
discussions in "full public view".


<p>I ordered a new 6 gig disk for the server machine (100 Mhz
Pentium, 32MB memory) a few weeks ago. I had two 1 gig disks. A
colleague suggested I should wait for new disk to arrive, as what I
had might not suffice to manage the mail lists. The disk arrived
yesterday morning. I had a lot of meetings that day, but did find the
time to install the disk and did a fresh install of RedHat 5.2.

<p>I've asked for some help in setting up the system. Though I've
used Unix for almost two decades, I've hardly ever had the
opportunity to log in as root. Indeed, I'm still such a newbie in
this area that when I log in as root I still feel a rush -- it's like
sitting in a Ferrari and putting the pedal to the metal. Away we go!

<p>Unfortunately, I have proven very adept at doing a great deal of
ecological damage to a pristine Linux landscape in a short time. My
specialty is reducing /etc/aliases to rubble -- think of the
oft-shown TV footage of an old building being demolished by a few
pounds of dynamite.

<p>I've asked for help doing things right, and hope it will arrive
soon. If not, I'll steam on and promise to be more careful. I will
make a best effort to be able to accept subscriptions early next week.


<h3 align=center>The Jikes Coupon</h3>

<p>I drive my daughter Jennifer to school every morning. Ever since
the start of the school year, she's been the object of a constant
flood of news and concerns about releasing the Jikes source code. She
has always been a rapt listener; indeed, I boasted to a friend
recently that my daughter was "<em>THE</em> world export in open
source licensing issues in the 14-and-under age category".

<p>We both share the same birthday -- December 8. My favorite present
was a set of six Jikes Coupons.  Here is the text of a Jikes Coupon:

<blockquote>
<center><em>Jikes Coupon</em></center>
<center><em>Value: 10 Minutes</em></center>

<p>This coupon entitles David Shields to 10 free minutes of
Jennifer's undivided attention to talk about Jikes or whatever he
sees fit. During this time, Jennifer may not think or say in any way,
"Oh, gosh, here he goes again." Even phrases such as, "We're playing
with the big boys" will be tolerated with a pleasant nod and smile.

</blockquote>

<p>I realized that I had mistaken a pleasant node and smile for keen
interest and concern. However, I have learned a valuable lesson and
it forms the basis of my new policy when asked about open source
licensing issues.

<p>While I had a role in drafting the Jikes License, now that it is
out it has become the responsibility of the IBM attorneys, and only
they have the authority to effect changes to it. My making statements
about it, especially misdirected efforts to interpret it, can only
lead to confusion. So from now on, when asked to speak about these
matters my response will be silent and simple -- a pleasant nod and a
smile.

<p>I have great confidence in our attorneys. I know they want to do
the right thing. I have found them to be quite pleasant, and have
even seen them smile from time to time.

<h3 align=center>Congratulations to Rob Malda</h3>

<p>I know that all fellow members of the slashdot community join me
in congratulating Rob Malda on completing the work for his
undergraduate degree. Sengan informs me Rob is getting a B.S. in
Computer Science, and also a B.A. (or perhaps minor) in the Arts. I
regret that I do not know the name of his college. I know he is eager
to resume hacking.

<h3 align=center>Newest Member of the Jikes Team: Vadim Zaliva</h3>

<p>We posted the source for Jikes at 1PM EST on Monday, December 7th.
I received an e-mail the same day 9:13 PM from Vadim Zaliva
(lord@crocodile.org) that included a patch file. He also posted the
patch in the "Discussion Area" for Jikes Source at the alphaworks
site.

<p>Philippe is on vacation, and I didn't get a chance to speak to him
after we published the source until late Wednesday afternoon. He
asked me if I had seen the patch at alphaworks. I said I had gotten
an e-mail but hadn't had time to look at. He said he was
"flabbergasted". Though the patch contains only a few lines, it shows
a good understanding of much of the compiler structure. I view this
as our first success story, and I am sure there are more to come; I
view it as a joint tribute to Philippe's design and Vadim's
demonstrated skills.

<p>At the end of the call, we had the following exchange:
<blockquote>
Philippe: Dave, this guy is good. Think he could come work with us?
<p>
Dave: Philippe, he already <strong>is</strong> working with us -- and for <strong>free</strong>!
</blockquote>

I asked Philippe to report in full on the technical knowledge
displayed, but he has some personal business, and I have gone ahead
here, as I did not want to delay recognizing Vadim's work. We are
pleased to welcome him aboard as the first contributor to join our
project since we released the source (there are other contributors I
wish to name for work done before we released the source, and I'll
try to provide details on our web site early next week).

<p>It's hard to express a "pleasant nod and a smile" over the
internet.  It's also hard to express a hand shake. My daughter Jen
designed a great masthead for the Jikes web site using a masthead
design tool built by Chet Murthy and others (Chet is the guy who used
to do the libc5 builds -- I told him he had done his last build late
last week). Unfortunately, IBM requires a uniform look-and-feel on
its web pages, and I am not able to use her work, though I will put
up a copy elsewhere on the Jikes web site soon, and am enclosing a
copy of it along with this note, and hope that slashdot and
LinuxToday can find a way to display it as a sign of welcome -- both
to Vadim and to all the future contributors that I expect to meet
soon via the Jikes mail lists.

<h2 align=center>Announcement posted to Slashdot.org on 7 December 1998</h2>
<br>
<h3 align=center>Jikes is Now Open Source</h3>

<p>On behalf of <a href="http://www.ibm.com/research">IBM
Research</a>, Philippe Charles and Dave Shields are pleased to
announce that the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/research/jikes">IBM
Research Jikes Compiler</a> is now an Open Source Project.  You can
<a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/formula/jikesos">download the
source now</a>.

<p>We will continue to work on the compiler, emphasizing -- as we
always have -- strict adherence to the Java Language Specification,
and will also continue to seek Sun's guidance on the proper
interpretation of the specification where we find the intent to be
unclear.

<p>All discussion will be carried out in full public view using
mailing lists. You can <a
href="http://www.ibm.com/research/jikes/subscribe">subscribe here</a>.

<p>We look forward to collaborating with the Java and Open Source
communities to make Jikes an even better compiler, and will welcome
voluntary contributions early in 1999  -- after we've
all had a chance to get acquainted via the mailing list before hacking away,
and after the two of us take some vacation time.

<p>We wish to thank the many Slashdot readers who gave of their time
to respond to our query "Should IBM Release the Source Code for
Jikes?" (see the 
<a href="http://domino.watson.ibm.com/syssftpr/JavaTech/Jikes.nsf/Named/JikesOpenSourceUserCommentsSummary">
Comment Summary</a>)
, and also thank
Sengan Baring-Gould (<a href="http://slashdot.org">slashdot</a>),
Nelson Minar (<a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/~nelson/">MIT</a>)
and
Bruce Perens
(<a href="http://opensource.org">opensource.org</a>)
 -- they helped make this happen.
