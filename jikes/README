If you want to build jikes on a system that does not support
autoconf, you can try the editing the src/Makefile.hand to
create a Makefile for your system. There are a number of
clauses at the start of Makefile.hand giving the options
needed for several systems.  All the clauses have
been commented out. You need to uncomment the clause for
your system before using this file, or create a clause
using the ones available as a guide.

You can also obtain set of test programs (jikestst) from
http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/jikes/project/pub/index.html

If you have further questions, you can consult the archives of the
Jikes mailing lists, or subscribe to the Jikes list and then seek
