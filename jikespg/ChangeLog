	* Makefile: Changed default from AIX to gcc (but it is
	still hardcoded.  Anyone want to autoconfiscate this project?)
	* ctabs.c (init_file, exit_file, exit_parser_files)
	(print_definitions): 
	* common.h: 
	* globals.c: 
	* lpgparse.c (options): 
	* lpgparse.h: Added option jikes, to hack in headers
	and footers to files generated by jikespg.
